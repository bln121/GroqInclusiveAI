*(Add links if you want)*(GitHub / LinkedIn / Role)  

### Your Approach:  
- Why you choose this problem  
    We selected this problem because India‚Äôs linguistic diversity and the needs of sensory-impaired individuals highlight a critical gap in accessible digital communication. We wanted to leverage Groq‚Äôs advanced AI capabilities to create an inclusive solution that empowers diverse users, aligning with our passion for innovation and social impact.
- Key challenges you addressed  
    1. Developing a system that supports real-time multilingual speech-to-text, speech-to-speech, text-to-text and text-to-speech conversion in English, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Hindi, ensuring accuracy across    diverse accents and dialects.
    2. Designing an accessible AI chatbot that caters to sensory-impaired users, requiring robust integration of text and audio modalities powered by Groq.
    3. Ensuring a seamless user experience (UX) with high design quality, addressing the complexity of handling multiple modalities (text, audio) effectively.
- Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking  
    1. Initially, we brainstormed a broader language set but pivoted to focus on English, Telugu, Tamil,Kannada and Hindi to prioritize depth and performance within the hackathon timeframe.
    2. A breakthrough came when we discovered Groq's ability to handle audio processing, enabling us to integrate real-time voice interaction, significantly enhancing accessibility for visually impaired users.
    3. We held multiple brainstorming sessions to refine the chatbot's context-aware responses, leading to a pivot from generic replies to tailored solutions for sensory-impaired users, improving overall usability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Core Technologies Used:
- Frontend: React.js and Bootstrap
- Backend: Python and FastAPI
- APIs: Groq
- Hosting: AWS

### Sponsor Technologies Used (if any):
- [‚úÖ] **Groq:**:
    Groq was utilized as the core AI engine to power the multilingual text translation feature. The application leverages Groq's API (via the llama3-70b-8192 model) to translate text between languages such as English, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, and Tamil. The translation process is integrated into a FastAPI backend, where Groq processes user input and returns translated text in real-time, enhancing the application's ability to address communication barriers in diverse linguistic contexts.

### Local Setup:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-team/inclusive-ai
# Navigate to the project directory
cd inclusive-ai

# Frontend setup
# Navigate to the frontend directory (if separate, assuming root here)
cd frontend
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Start the development server
npm start
# The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000 by default.
# Ensure the backend is running to handle API requests.

#Backend setup
# Navigate to the backend directory (if separate, assuming root here)
cd backend
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn requests gtts pydantic python-dotenv

# Start the backend server
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

## üèÅ Final Words

Share your hackathon journey ‚Äî challenges, learnings, fun moments, or shout-outs!

    Our hackathon journey was a whirlwind of creativity, collaboration, and caffeine! Building this multilingual AI application was both challenging and rewarding. We faced hurdles like configuring CORS for seamless frontend-backend communication and ensuring gTTS supported our target languages, but each obstacle taught us something new. The thrill of seeing the first successful translation and hearing the text-to-speech output was unforgettable!

    Key learnings included mastering FastAPI's async capabilities and optimizing React's lazy loading for performance. The fun moments? Late-night debugging sessions turned into laugh-fests, and we celebrated small wins with virtual high-fives. A huge shout-out to our team for their relentless energy, the hackathon organizers for an amazing platform, and the open-source community for tools that made this possible. We're excited to see where this project goes next!
